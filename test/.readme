# This is the root folder for all test suites. The most typical ones used are: 
# 
# Unit - test single class (or combination of classes) in isolation (database, etc not available).   
# Integration - test a execution flow in a fully working Magento (sand-boxed). 
# 
# HINT: You can generate the test cases with command provided by
#       testing-tools: https://docs.vaimo.com/module-testing-tools/commands.html 
#
# HINT: When considering removing Test folder, don't. Even a single test is better than
#       no tests at all. If you decide to skip writing tests, then at least keep the folder
#       around as a reminder that we've just several minutes away from having automated logic 
#       validation checks as part of your module building process.
